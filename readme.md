# DocSpec
The docspec is a specification for an interoperable file format that documenting tools, like JavaDoc, can use. These tools normally work in 3 steps:

1. Parsing the code mapping docblocks to code
2. Generate an abstract format with the contents for the documentation
3. Generate the documentation

The docspec is the output of the second step. This would decouple the parsing step from the output step, so that these two things could be developed independently. With the goal that there will be a pool of various documenting tools and a pool of various display tools and that makes it easy for end users to combine them on their needs.
